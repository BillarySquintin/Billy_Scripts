## Premiere Pro Scripts

# AutoNestClips

This script will automatically go through all of the clips in an open timeline and make them into nested clips while giving them an incremented name. I have set the F7 hotkey in Premiere to Nest the currently selected clip, and I removed the default F1 hotkey. 
Press F1 to start the script & Press F2 to pause. The clip names will be whatever's copied in your clipboard + an incremented number with a leading zero.
Beware, after all of the clips in the current timeline tab are complete the script will continue working in whatever other timelines you have open, so make sure you're watching with the F2 key on standby.
